# IPTV based on YouTube Live Channels

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**

Recent changes on YouTube have broken this service completely. If you want a functional solution, you must host the service on your local network. An executable of this service is available for [download](https://abskmj.github.io/notes/posts/projects/youtube-hls-server/).
